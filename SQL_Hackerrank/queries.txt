1. 
select DISTINCT CITY from STATION where MOD(ID, 2) = 0;
MOD here is modulus, eg 10 % 2 = 0

2. 
select (count(CITY) - count(DISTINCT(CITY))) from STATION;
select (count(CITY) - count(DISTINCT CITY)) from STATION;
select (count(*) - count(DISTINCT CITY)) from STATION;

3.
select CITY, length(CITY) from STATION order by length(CITY), CITY limit 1;
select CITY, length(CITY) from STATION order by length(CITY) DESC, CITY ASC limit 1;
limit 1 here returns the first result

(select city, length(city) from station order by length(city) desc, city asc limit 1)
union
(select city, length(city) from station order by length(city), city limit 1);
