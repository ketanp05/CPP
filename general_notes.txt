# Bubble sort 
- Time Complexity is O(n^2)

# O(logn) time complexity
- as the input size increases, number of operations grows slowly
- eg: binary tree
- Both insertion and deletion in a heap are O(logn) because they involve traversing up or down the height of the binary tree, which is logarithmic in the number of elements.
- O(nlogn) is the best worst case runtime we can get for sorting

# Memoization
- store results in cache, retrieve the same information from the cache the next time its needed instead of computing again
- In simpler words, it consists of storing in cache the output of a function, and making the function check if each required computation is in the cache before computing it.
